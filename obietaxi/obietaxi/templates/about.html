  <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
  <p>Obietaxi was written by Luke Lovett and Nate Teetor and designed by Liz Bennett and Meg Davis during winter and spring of 2013.</p>

  <h3>Using Obietaxi</h3>
  <p>Obietax was created specifically for the Oberlin community to address the complications of coordinating getting to/from places around Oberlin. While our exprience personally has been that people in Oberlin are largely trustworthy, you should consider your safety before offering or taking a ride from someone you connect with here. Obietaxi has a "trust" rating for each user that shows how many successful trips a user has completed using this tool, which you can use to help make your decisions about whether to take a ride/passenger or not. However, this is not an end-all solution. Please use your own judgement and be aware that Obietaxi takes no responsibility whatsoever for your safety. That is your job. Furthermore, the notion of "taxi" in this website applies to drivers only insofar as they transport passengers from one place to another, but we do not mean to imply any sort of obligatory fee associated with this job. In other words, we do not require passengers to pay their drivers anything (since they are not actually "taxis"), but don't be rude, thank your driver and reimburse their gas and time!</p>
